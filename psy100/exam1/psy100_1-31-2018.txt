Medulla & Spinal Cord
- typically called "brain stem"
- controls heartbeat and breathing
- persistent vegetative state - rest of brain is dead

Inner Brain
- Thalamus
	- switchboard of the brain
	- information to thalamus, then out to other parts of brain
- Hypothalamus
	- maintains homeostasis, temperature, ph, etc.
- Amygdala
	- main driver for anger and fear
- Hippocampus
	- formation of new memories and retrieval of old ones

Cerebellum
- controls balance and coordination
- shrinks as you get older

Cerebrum
- also known as crebral cortex
- occipital lobe
	- rear lobe
	- controls vision
- temporal lobe
	- controls hearing
	- on left side
- parietal lobe
	- controls body sensation
- frontal lobe
	- human brains dedicate largest portion of brain to frontal lobe in animal kingdom
	- controls movement
	- exective function
		- make plans
		- inhibitions
		- judgment
	- emotions
		- humans have more emotions than any other creature
- memories take up the rest of the cortex
	- each lobe has its own portion dedicated to the memories of the functions that lobe controls
		- hearing memories, visual memories, planning memories, body sensation memories, etc.
- alcohol
	- affects brain from front to back
	- judgment affected first
	- then inhibitions on emotions
	- then inhibitions on movements
	- then inhibitions on speech
	- then vision starts narrowing
	- then unable to move well


Learning
- a relatively permanent change in knowledge, skills, or attitudes
- learning by association
	- A = B
	- A -> C
	- B -> C
	- entire field of psychology based on learning by association
- classical conditioning (Pavlov)
	- Pavlov was a physiologist (a doctor)
		- was trying to study digestion
		- studied on dogs
		- found stomach acid
		- found saliva
		- meat was causing dogs to produce stomach acid and saliva
		- A -> B
		- rang bell, give meat
		- C -> B
		- cause and effect
			- stimulus and response
				- unconditioned and unconditioned stimuli and responses
