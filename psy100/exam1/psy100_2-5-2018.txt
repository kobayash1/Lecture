- strength of conditioning
	- frequency
		- (UCS + CS) x very many
		- pair stimuli and response as much as you can
	- timing
		- CS -> .5s -> UCS
	- intensity
		- UCS x super strong
	- reliability
		- (UCS + CS) = always

- law of effect (Thorndike)
	- if a behavior is followed by a consquence that is better than nothing, you will repeat the behavior
	- if a behavior is followed by a negative consequence, you will not repeat the behavior
	- if B -> C > 0, repeat B
	- if B -> C < 0, do not repeat B

- operant conditioning (Skinner)
	- took Thorndike's shit, renamed it himself
	- called the first principle "reinforcement"
	- shaping
		- gradually build behaviors
