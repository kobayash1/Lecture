- experimental design
	- change 'Independent Variable,' measure 'Dependent Variable'
	- change in 'DV' is caused by 'IV'
	- design must control all third variables
- how to control third variables
	- placebo when people change because hey think they're supposed to change
- statistics
	- measures of central tendency (averages)
		- mean (x with a bar above it or M)
			- vulnerable to outliers
		- median
			- halfway from top and bottom, regardless of values
			- score of average person
			- mitigates problem of outliers
		- mode
			- used when dealing with categorical data
			- most frequently occuring value
	- measures of variability
		- range
			- high score minus low score
		- standard deviation
			- average deviation
	- correlation coefficient (r)
		- how related two things are
		- -1 to 1
		- closer to 1 = positiive correlation
		- closer to -1 = negative correlation
		- both negative and positive correlation mean stronger relationship, closer to 0 = no correlation
