	- survey - ask a lot of people a few questions
		- need trained survey writer

			- don't want to admit they're naughty
			- don't want to admit they're ignorant

		- harder to fake/lie
		- tend to be at the end of the research process
- research designs
	- correlational
		- measure 'A'
		- measure 'B'
		- does knowing 'A' help you predict 'B'?
		- limits
			- no control over 'A' or 'B'
			- only predictions
				- not a bad thing
		- prediction vs explanation
			- correlational study is concerned with prediction, not explanation
			- trying to explain leads to "The Third Variable Problem"
				- correlation has only 2 variables
