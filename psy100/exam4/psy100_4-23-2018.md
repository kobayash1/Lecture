+ gets killed with 38 witnesses
+ no one calls for help until some other witness finally does much later

+ dispositional
	+ person did it because that is the kind of person they are
	+ pre-disposed

	+ there's also reciprocal disliking
+ liking through association
	+ associated with something happy, we like them, even if they didn't do anything in particular
	+ being around when something good happens, makes people think of you good


## Self vs Other

+ stereotype
	+ beliefs about the members of a group
+ prejudice
	+ stereotype plus emotion
	+ love x
	+ hate x
	+ fear x
	+ people tend to prejudice only on things they care about

+ discrimination
	+ treating people differently based on group membership
	+ makes sense if based on an accurate stereotype


## In-Group vs Out-Group

+ "us and them"
+ us is better, a lot more thems
+ leads to destructive discriminations and prejudices
