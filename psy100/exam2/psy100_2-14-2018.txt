Memory

Schema
	- your idea, your expectation
	- close idea to the real actual thing
		- penny - copper colored coin with Lincoln on it
			- not exact

Process
- encoding
	- putting a memory in terms you can understand
	- language you understand
- storage
	- once memory is stored, memory exists as long as neuron exists
- retrieval
	- getting memories back out
	- most of them, you can't

Models
	- formed memory is a small bump on a dendrite

- Stage Model
	- short-term memory
		- short duration
			- about 30 seconds
		- capacity
			- 7 +/-2 CHUNKS
				- chunk - bit of meaningful information
					- chunks can be huge
	- long-term memory
		- if information is important, it will be shifted into long-term memory
		- duration
			- long duration (as long as the neuron is intact
		- capacity
			- huge
			- every memory you form gives you capacity to form more memories
		- different types of information
			- declarative (explicit)
				- memories of things you can say
				- semantic
					- facts, figures or trivia
						- facts - important; trivia - not important
				- episodic
					- stories in your life
					- don't kick in until you're three years old
					- you make stuff up to make the story make sense to you
					- easiest memories to form, easiest to lose
			- non-declarative (implicit)
				- memories of things you can't say
					- example: what does it feel like to be hugged
					- sense memories
				- procedural
					- how to
						- motor functions like walking, riding bicycle, etc.
						- practice
					- hardest to learn
						- only way to learn is to practice it
					- hardest to lose
						- "just like riding a bike"

- Stage Model
	- Spreading Activation (Network) Model
		- Nodes
			- Specific memories
		- Links
			- Connections between memories
			- links can be various strengths
			- positive and negative links
		- overlays into brain very well
		- strength of memories is based on number of links
			- importance

- what doesn't work well
	- highlighting
	- mnemonics
	- cramming

- what does work
	- spaced practice
	- practice testing
		- learn what you do and do not know
	- elaborative rehearsal
		- fancy word for learning

Memorization vs Learning
	- memorization
		- two nodes, practice the link over and over until link is strong
		- over time, links fade
	- learning
		- learning is a procedure
		- practice

Forgetting
- the inability to retrieve information

- decay
	- memories do not decay
	- memories are actual formed memories in brain
	- over time, links decay

- encoding failure
	- you didnt put memory in terms you could understanding
	- leads to forgetting

- consolidation failure
	- consolidation is process of physically growing a memory
	- brain did not grow the memory
	- cause is something fairly significant
		- car accident, trauma, etc.
		- brain dumps anything not necessary for survival
		- recording memory is dumped for survival
	- 30 minutes to record a memory
		- you will forget the past 30 memories before the trauma
		- eventually try to piece together

- motivated forgetting
	- create a link that says "don't look"
	- only works when there are not a lot of other links to memory trying to forget
	- works for small things, not big traumatic things

- interference
	- other information gets in the way
		- information is very similar
			- focus on differences to differentiate
		- information is extreme
			- extreme information comes up first
			- no way to deal with this

- retrieval cue failure
	- you're looking in the wrong part of your network
	- dependent memory
		- context dependent
			- physical location
			- lighting
			- temperature
			- smell-based
		- state dependent
			- internal state - how you feel
				- healthy? sick?
					- healthy memories, sick memories
			- mood
				- happy, sad, fearful memories

Cognition
- thinking
- concepts/schema
	- ideas
	- formal concept
		- based on a set of rules
		- "this thing does this thing"
		- rules cannot be broken
		- learned in a formal setting
			- someone taught you
	- natural concept
		- based on guidelines
		- not absolute
		- fuzzy concept
		- prototype
			- the one that meets the most guidelines
		- learned from experience
			- learns from personal experience
		- exemplar
			- your own personal prototype
			- when we think, we think with exemplars

Reasoning (logic)
- coming to a conlcusion
- two types of reasoning
- deductive
	- conclusion must be true
	- "by definition"
- inductive
	- probably true
		- sun rising in the east is inductive
			- sun could blow up today, and not rise in the east

Problem Solving
- trial and error
	- try shit
	- pure trial and error has no rhyme or reason
	- no barrier to trying the same thing twice
	- fatal on an individual level, brilliant for a species
- algorithm
	- step by step procedure for solving a problem
	- if a solution exists, an algorithm will find it
- heuristic
	- a rule of thumb
	- doesn't always work
	- availability
		- make judgments on most easily available source of information
			- our brain
				- based on stuff we already know
	- representativeness
		- make judgments based on stereotypes
	- anchoring
		- stick with initial opinion

Barriers to problem solving
- mental set
	- viewing the wrong problem
	- functional fixedness
		- view an item as having only one function
	- confirmation bias
		- we try to prove ourselves right
			- this is wrong
		- hard to prove infinity
			- easy to prove wrong
	- framing
		- how you ask the question matters
		- human beings are win positive and risk averse
			- love winning, hate losing
		- frame things as a win, people willl go toward it, loss, people will go away
		- e.g. 99% fat free vs 1% pure fat

Intelligence
- who is 'smart'?
- what is 'smart'?
- multiple ways to be smart
- Multiple Intelligences (Gardner)
	- math (logic)
	- linguistic (verbal)
	- spatial (dimensions)
	- interpersonal (understanding other people)
	- intrapersonal (understanding yourself)
	- bodily (kinesthetic)
	- musical
	- naturalistic (understanding nature)
- history of intelligence testing
	- Binet
		- France, late 1800's
		- tried to identify slow learning kids
		- writes test 30 questions long, meant for pre-schoolers
		- questions got harder and harder
		- mental age determined by when you started to get questions wrong
		- mental age compared with physical age
	- Goddard
		- America, early 1900's
		- tested theory of smart kids from smart parents
		- takes copy of Binet's test to New York
			- tests Americans in New York, 98% pass
			- tests immigrants in New York
				- failure rates:
					- Hungary 80%
					- Italy 79%
					- Jewish 83%
					- Russia 87%
		- suggested those who failed to be forcibly sterilized
			- sent to institutions if found by a court to be feeble minded
			- feeble mindedness made illegal
			- Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927)
	- Terman
		- America, early 1900's
		- Intelligence Quotient
			- (MA/PA) x 100
				- mental age divided by physical age multiplied by 100
	- Yerkes
		- worked for US military
		- sort people's intelligence to make basic training more effective
		- group testing
			- test 2 million men
		- alpha test
			- for literate
		- beta test
			- for illiterate
		- intelligence is potential
		- beta test was flawed
	- Wechsler
		- 1950's
		- one-on-one
		- lose information on a group test
			- are they motivated? are they sick? etc.
		- low scores of group test get one-on-one attention
			- school psychologists
				- need training and psychometric theory
		- subscales
			- categories, sub tests
			- IQ test -> math section, verbal section, etc.
		- last great advance in intelligence testing
- IQ Interpretation
	- bell curve
	- 100 is average score
	- std dev +-15
	- IQ is speed, higher the number, the faster you think
		- not necessarily better
	- 68% of people between 85 and 115
		- average
	- 115-130 
		- above average
	- 70-85
		- below average
	- 70-130
		- 95% of people
	- >130
		- 2.5%
		- gifted
	- <70
		- retard
		- changed name to intellectual disability
		- deficiencies in adaptive skills
			- problems learning new things

Levels of Intellectual Disability
- educable
	- can learn, just takes longer
	- teach essential things
	- work jobs that don't change
		- problems learning new things
- trainable
	- can perform a task
	- typically going to live in a group home
	- problems with social skills
- custodial
	- live in instituion
	- often linked with physical defects
		- life expectancy is shorter
	- slow by a factor of 20 to 30
Differences in IQ
- gender
	- total
		- equal
	- math
		- girls and men score higher
	- verbal
		- female score higher
	- spatial
		- 
- racial
	- asian -> white -> hispanic -> black
	- probably due to ecoonomic differences
